# Redirect

## Overview

**Redirect** is a 2D top-down multiplayer game developed by team OmegaSpaceHackoon during the 20-hour WSEICRAFT hackathon. In this unique game, two players battle in a dark arena where walls block the light from their flashlights. Equip yourself with a flashlight to navigate and a pistol that fires bullets which bounce off walls. The objective is simple: defeat your opponent by scoring as many kills as possible.
